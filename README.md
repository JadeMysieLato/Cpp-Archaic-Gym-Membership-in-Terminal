# C++ Gym Membership in Terminal
This is a simple practice code to help me grasp the basics of C++ by gathering user-input, performing a function and utilizing switch-cases and if-statements. This is the base of the basics. The program expects a linear progression and the user to use simple logic. There is no database. Pure contextual, imitating an imaginary conversation between a gym staff and a gym-goer.

I will come back to this program in the future to improve this project. Or use this code as reference in the future to create a better project.
